# Data Structures and Algorithms

Algorithms are used to manipulate and process data. Data structures are useful in maintaining and storing data, but algorithms are what actually utilize that data.

## Data structures handle four main functions for us:

Inputting information
Processing information
Maintaining information
Retrieving information

## Algorithms

Simply put, algorithms are instructions that the computer follows to carry out tasks. There are many, many types of algorithms, but some common ones that you will encounter in this course (and likely the world!) are:

Sorting algorithms
Search algorithms
Divide and conquer algorithms
Greedy algorithms
Brute force algorithms

# NODES

They form the basis for linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more. They are the building blocks for many other data structures.

`node_a ["Data:5", "Link: node_b"]`

the link is the pointer to another node. The data is
the information that the node contains.
